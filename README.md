# Bacterial Blight Prediction of Pomegranate fruit

Bacterial blight on pomegranate is a major disease. Pomegranate bacterial blight has become a very serious threat to pomegranate growers in the country. Bacterial blight in pomegranate leads to deceased yield (nearly by 90 %) and quality of fruits affecting the marketing value of fruits.  This prediction system will do the detection immediately so that early detection will helps the farmer to avoid the loss by some extend. It is not possible to all farmers sometime to do the open eye prediction. Also agriculture domain expert are not available all the time or there charges of the solution will be high.

# Primary Goal
This helps to farmer to check the pomegranate fruit is affected by Bacterial Blight disease or not.

# Dataset Preparation For Training
I have created the training dataset by taking the advise of agriculture domain expert so that final system will give more robust results. Here are the few sample of images used for training the system

# Steps To Be Followed To Test Image

1) User will upload the image of Pomegranate fruit by using web based application.

2) Application will show the result for the query image that it is affected by bacterial blight or not. 


# Guidelines To User For Test Image Capture

 1) Here user will capute the image of Pomegranate by using mobile or camera.

 2) Plase take care while capturing the image that whole image of the fruit will be clear so that detection of the disease will be  more accurate.
 
 3) If possible try to hold the white paper as background so that there will more clear image of Pomegranate with less noise.
 
 4) Try to capture the more images for the different parts of the farm and test all of them to get the clear idea or exact severity  of the disease.
  
  
## How To Upload the Image
Here user has to upload the query image to be tested
